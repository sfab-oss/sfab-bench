# sfab-bench

CAD on your Mac. Talk to it with the AI you already pay for.

Open a folder, open a STEP, talk with Codex, Claude Code, Grok, or OpenCode
already on the machine. This app does not take API keys for chat. Quest
Browser on the same Wi-Fi joins that process.

## After you install

Open a folder, open a STEP or GLB, then talk. This app does not author CAD.

- Already have parts: **Open folder** and pick that directory.
- Starting from scratch: clone
  [sfab-bench-starter](https://github.com/sfab-oss/sfab-bench-starter), Open
  that folder, pick `cad/block.step`. The starter already has Jake's
  [CAD skill](https://github.com/earthtojake/text-to-cad) and a Bench
  skill. Ask in chat for another part.

Do not open this app repo as a CAD project. It has no parts.
