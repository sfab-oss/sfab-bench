/**
 * `resolveArtifact` is where a string becomes a file read.
 *
 * The string can come from an assistant calling `show_artifact`, or from a `?file=`
 * in a URL, so "is this inside the open project" is the only thing standing between
 * a chat message and the filesystem. That deserves to be stated as a table rather
 * than read and trusted.
 *
 * The other half is just as load-bearing and much easier to miss: the `rel` it
 * hands back is the viewer's fetch URL, the value returned to the assistant, and
 * the recents entry, and it comes straight back in on the next request. A `rel`
 * that does not resolve is a file that opens once and never again.
 *
 * Note that escaping the project is guarded twice over: the `..` check on the way
 * in, and the realpath containment test on the way out. Removing either one alone
 * still refuses every case below, which is the point of having both.
