# Circuit reference traces

ngspice 45.2, inside `eecircuit-engine` 1.8.0. The decks use gear,
`temp=25`, `tnom=25`, `gmin=1e-12`, and a max step equal to the engine
step. The run header was `Command: ngspice-45.2, Build Sat Sep  5 01:00:10 UTC 2026`.

Generator: `scratch/layered-sim/port-circuit-ref` @
`0715661821eb8f1f254948818836e8d45d54ece0`.

```bash
cd /abs/path/port-circuit-ref
npm install
npx tsx generate.ts /abs/path/apps/server/fixtures/circuit
```

`npm install` links E1's already-installed `eecircuit-engine`
(`file:../e1/node_modules/eecircuit-engine`). That package is not a
dependency of sfab-bench.

Transient files are a `.cir` deck and a CSV of time (s) and the probe
(V), at most 2000 points, SI. The pot files are the mid-scale deck
(α = 0.5). The JSON sweep uses the same topology with the two divider
resistors changed, and records wiper and rail voltage (V).
